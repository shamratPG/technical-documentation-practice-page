                Flexbox is a powerful, well-supported layout method that was introduced with the latest version of CSS,
                CSS3. With flexbox, it's easy to center elements on the page and create dynamic user interfaces that
                shrink and expand automatically.

                This section uses alternating challenge styles to show how to use CSS to position elements in a flexible
                way. First, a challenge will explain theory, then a practical challenge using a simple tweet component
                will apply the flexbox concept.

                Placing the CSS property display: flex; on an element allows you to use other flex properties to build a

                Adding display: flex to an element turns it into a flex container. This makes it possible to align any
                children of that element into rows or columns. You do this by adding the flex-direction property to the
                parent item and setting it to row or column. Creating a row will align the children horizontally, and
                creating a column will align the children vertically.

            <p>
                Sometimes the flex items within a flex container do not fill all the space in the container. It is
                common to want to tell CSS how to align and space out the flex items a certain way. Fortunately, the
                justify-content property has several options to do this. But first, there is some important terminology
                to understand before reviewing those options.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are several options for how to space the flex items along the line that is the main axis. One of
                the most commonly used is justify-content: center;, which aligns all the flex items to the center inside
                the flex container. Other options include:
            </p>

            <ul class="lists">
                <li>
                    <strong>flex-start:</strong> aligns items to the start of the flex container. For a row, this pushes
                    the items to the left of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the top of the
                    container. This is the default alignment if no justify-content is specified.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>flex-end:</strong> aligns items to the end of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the
                    items to the right of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the bottom of the
                    container.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>space-between:</strong> aligns items to the center of the main axis, with extra space placed
                    between the items. The first and last items are pushed to the very edge of the flex container. For
                    example, in a row the first item is against the left side of the container, the last item is against
                    the right side of the container, then the remaining space is distributed evenly among the other
                    items.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>space-around:</strong> similar to space-between but the first and last items are not locked
                    to the edges of the container, the space is distributed around all the items with a half space on
                    either end of the flex container.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>space-evenly:</strong> Distributes space evenly between the flex items with a full space at
                    either end of the flex container.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="code">
                <code>
            elemen-name {
            justify-content: center;

        <section id="align-items" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>align-items</h2>
            </header>

            <p>
                The align-items property is similar to justify-content. Recall that the justify-content property aligned
                flex items along the main axis. For rows, the main axis is a horizontal line and for columns it is a
                vertical line.
            </p>
            <p>
                The different values available for align-items include:
            </p>
            <ul class="lists">
                <li>
                    <strong>flex-start:</strong> aligns items to the start of the flex container. For rows, this aligns
                    items to the top of the container. For columns, this aligns items to the left of the container.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>flex-end:</strong> aligns items to the end of the flex container. For rows, this aligns
                    items to the bottom of the container. For columns, this aligns items to the right of the container.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> center:</strong> align items to the center. For rows, this vertically aligns items (equal
                    space above and below the items). For columns, this horizontally aligns them (equal space to the
                    left and right of the items).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>stretch:</strong> stretch the items to fill the flex container. For example, rows items are
                    stretched to fill the flex container top-to-bottom. This is the default value if no align-items
                    value is specified.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>baseline:</strong> align items to their baselines. Baseline is a text concept, think of it
                    as the line that the letters sit on.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="code">
                <code>
            element-name {
            align-items: center;
            }
          </code>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="flex-wrap" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>flex-wrap</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                CSS flexbox has a feature to split a flex container into multiple rows (or columns). By default, a flex
                container will fit all flex items together. For example, a row will all be on one line.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, using the flex-wrap property tells CSS to wrap items. This means extra items move into a new
                row or column. The break point of where the wrapping happens depends on the size of the items and the
                size of the container.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS also has options for the direction of the wrap:
            </p>
            <ul class="lists">
                <li>
                    <strong>nowrap:</strong> this is the default setting, and does not wrap items.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>wrap:</strong> wraps items onto multiple lines from top-to-bottom if they are in rows and
                    left-to-right if they are in columns.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>wrap-reverse:</strong> wraps items onto multiple lines from bottom-to-top if they are in
                    rows and right-to-left if they are in columns.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="flex-shrink" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>flex-shrink</h2>
            </header>

            <p>
                The first is the flex-shrink property. When it's used, it allows an item to shrink if the flex container
                is too small. Items shrink when the width of the parent container is smaller than the combined widths of
                all the flex items within it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The flex-shrink property takes numbers as values. The higher the number, the more it will shrink
                compared to the other items in the container. For example, if one item has a flex-shrink value of 1 and
                the other has a flex-shrink value of 3, the one with the value of 3 will shrink three times as much as
                the other.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="flex-grow" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>flex-grow</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                The opposite of flex-shrink is the flex-grow property. Recall that flex-shrink controls the size of the
                items when the container shrinks. The flex-grow property controls the size of items when the parent
                container expands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using a similar example from the last challenge, if one item has a flex-grow value of 1 and the other
                has a flex-grow value of 3, the one with the value of 3 will grow three times as much as the other.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="align-self" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>align-self</h2>
            </header>'
            <p>
                The final property for flex items is align-self. This property allows you to adjust each item's
                alignment individually, instead of setting them all at once. This is useful since other common
                adjustment techniques using the CSS properties float, clear, and vertical-align do not work on flex
                items.

                align-self accepts the same values as align-items and will override any value set by the align-items
                property.

            </p>
